# Bank-Management-System
I have developed a console based project on bank management system. Data is being loaded from .txt file using FileInputStream. 
In this project I have use all the core java concept. Also use ArrayList to store objects. 
I have also used Unit testing to test each method and make it future proof so that its easier to find bug and fix it. While creating this project i explored lambda expression 
and use that where needed.
